# Responsible AI (Fairness, Privacy, Security)

**Goal:** Ship models safely and ethically.

## Fairness
- Bias types; group metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds).
- Data auditing; balanced sampling; post‑processing.

## Privacy
- PII handling; minimization; anonymization; differential privacy (intuition).

## Security
- Threat modeling; adversarial examples (intuition); supply chain security.

## Governance
- Documentation (model cards, datasheets); review gates; human oversight.

## Exercises
1. Define a fairness metric suitable for a hiring model and justify.
2. List data you must not store for a healthcare app and why.
3. Draft a one‑page model card for any chapter model.
