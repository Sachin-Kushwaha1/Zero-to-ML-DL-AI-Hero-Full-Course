# Capstone Projects & Rubrics

**Goal:** Build portfolio‑ready projects that demonstrate end‑to‑end skill.

## Project Ideas
1. **Tabular:** Loan default prediction (imbalanced) with calibrated probabilities.
2. **Vision:** Waste sorting classifier with transfer learning.
3. **NLP:** News topic classifier with TF‑IDF + Linear SVM vs small Transformer fine‑tune.
4. **Time Series:** Energy demand forecasting with lag features + gradient boosting.

## Rubric (Self‑Assessment)
- Problem framing (clear target/metric) — 10
- Data quality & EDA — 15
- Baseline & comparisons — 15
- Evaluation rigor (CV, metrics, leakage) — 20
- Deployment readiness (API, tests, docs) — 20
- Responsible AI considerations — 10
- Communication (README, visuals) — 10
**Total: 100**

## Deliverables
- Clean repo: `/src`, `/notebooks`, `/data`, `/models`, `/api`, README.md
- Repro steps: `requirements.txt`, `make train`, `make evaluate`, `make serve`
- Demo: screenshots or short video.

## Exercises
- Pick one idea; write a one‑page proposal with timeline and risks.
