# Zeroâ€‘toâ€‘MLâ€‘DLâ€‘AI: A Complete Beginnerâ€‘Friendly Course

Welcome! This is a selfâ€‘contained, **chapterâ€‘wise** course that teaches Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and practical AI **from scratch**, with detailed explanations and beginnerâ€‘friendly examples.  
Everything you need is included hereâ€”no external material required.

## How to Use This Course
1. Read chapters in order (files are numbered).
2. Run the Python code samples on your machine (Anaconda/venv). You can copyâ€‘paste from Markdown.
3. Do the **Exercises** at the end of each chapter.
4. Use the **Capstone** chapter to build a portfolioâ€‘ready project.
5. Keep the **Appendix** handy for formulas, checklists, and cheatsheets.

## Prerequisites
- Comfortable with basic Python (variables, loops, functions). We also include a Python/Numpy/Pandas refresher.
- Laptop with Python 3.9+ and recommended packages (see `requirements.txt`).
