# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in improving Zero-to-ML-DL-AI-Hero-Full-Course!

## Ways to contribute
- Fix typos, broken links, or formatting in modules `01_` to `20_`.
- Add exercises, quizzes, or small datasets with clear licenses.
- Contribute Jupyter notebooks that mirror modules for hands-on practice.
- Improve explanations with diagrams or examples.

## Getting started
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Set up the Python environment (see README).
3. If adding notebooks or data, keep files small and link to larger datasets.
4. Run formatting and checks locally if possible; CI will run on PRs.

## Content conventions
Each module should begin with:
- Objectives
- Prerequisites
- Estimated Time
- Key Terms
- References

Formatting:
- Use consistent heading levels and fenced code blocks.
- Reference external resources with durable links (prefer canonical docs).
- Cross-link previous/next modules at the bottom of each file.

## Pull requests
- Keep PRs focused and small.
- Include a short description and screenshots if applicable.
- Ensure links render and code blocks are valid.
